# AI Assignment

The notebook AI_Assignment.ipynb is analyzing credit card fraud from a dataset card_transdata.csv. I utilized ChatGPT-5 mini in Visual Studio Code to assist in creating the code necessary for this analysis. 

There were several concrete benefits that I saw by utilizing AI to help me make the notebook. Firstly, it was able to easily create basic code that is necessary in every analysis, such as important libraries like pandas and numpy. Secondly, by giving it enough descriptions, it was able to generate accurate plots that aid the analysis. For someone who hasn't learned data science properly, the dangers that I see are that the AI agent can create a lot of code to make simple charts, and if an attribute is not exactly what they want, it could be hard to debug the code to fix it. For example, in generating a (barchart stacked, making sure it is all good...)

b. What dangers do you see for someone using AI to make this notebook without learning data science properly? Give concrete examples.

c. Give examples where you needed to verify the AI output for correctness. How did you know to verify those outputs?
